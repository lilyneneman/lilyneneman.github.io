    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past ten seasons, Creighton basketball has built a reputation as a consistently competitive program in NCAA Men’s Basketball. Their move to the Big East in 2013 marked a turning point for the program, introducing them to new expectations. Since then, the bluejay’s have built a reputation for fast-paced play, player development, and a strong postseason.\nBut beyond wins and tournament appearance, what do the numbers actually show us about where Creighton Basketball is headed? This analysis takes a close look at the past decade using three data points: win-loss percentages, performance metrics (SRS and SOS), and season-by-season scoring patterns. These insights offer a view of Creighton’s growth since entering the Big East and show where they may be headed.\n\n\nCode\nknitr:: opts_chunk$set(\n  echo = TRUE,\n  message = FALSE,\n  warning = FALSE,\n  results = 'hide'\n)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)  \nbasketball_data &lt;- read.csv(\"creightonmbb.csv\", header = TRUE, skip = 1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncolnames(basketball_data)[colnames(basketball_data) == \"W.L.\"] &lt;- \"WL_Percent\"\nbasketball_data$Season &lt;- sub(\"^(\\\\d{4})-.*$\", \"\\\\1\", basketball_data$Season)\nbasketball_data$Season &lt;- as.numeric(basketball_data$Season)\n\nbb &lt;- basketball_data %&gt;% filter(Season &gt;= 2014 & Season &lt;= 2025)\nggplot(bb, aes(x = Season, y = WL_Percent)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +              \n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 3) +  \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = bb$Season) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A Year-By-Year Look at Creighton's Winning Consistency under Coach Greg McDermott\",\n    subtitle = \"Overall Win-Loss Percentage by Season (2014-2025)\",\n    y = \"Win-Loss Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Author: Lily Neneman | Source: Sports-Reference.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(WL_Percent, 2)), vjust = -0.5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line graph tracks Creighton’s win-loss percentage for each season.\nWhile there are fluctuations, which is expected over a decade, the overall win rate remains high. Several seasons approached or exceeded 70% win, and only a single season drops below the .500 mark. This graph shows the immense growth of the team since the 2014 season. Creighton proves to be a consistent team based on win-loss percentage and this speaks to the programs ability to succeed year after year.\n\n\nCode\nbb$Season &lt;- as.numeric(sub(\"^(\\\\d{4})-.*$\", \"\\\\1\", bb$Season))\nhead(bb[, c(\"Season\", \"SRS\", \"SOS\")])\nbasketball_data$SRS &lt;- as.numeric(basketball_data$SRS)\nbasketball_data$SOS &lt;- as.numeric(basketball_data$SOS)\n\nbb &lt;- basketball_data %&gt;% filter(Season &gt;= 2013 & Season &lt;= 2025)\n\nggplot(bb, aes(x = Season)) +  \n  geom_line(aes(y = SRS, color = \"SRS\", group = 1), size = 1.2) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = SOS, color = \"SOS\", group = 2), size = 1.2) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"SRS\" = \"blue\", \"SOS\" = \"red\")) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2013, 2024, 1)) +  # Force integer seasons\n  labs(\n    title = \"Creighton's Schedule Strength and Performance Rating Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing SRS and SOS metrics across the past 10 seasons\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Metric Value\",\n    color = \"Metric\",\n    caption = \"Author: Lily Neneman | Source: Sports-Reference.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above tracks two metrics from Sports-Reference:\n\nSRS (Simple Rating System) captures a team’s overall performance, adjusted for opponent strength.\nSOS (Strength of Schedule) focuses only on how difficult a team’s schedule was.\n\nWhat we see is that Creighton has generally stayed a strong performing team across the past decade. The team’s SRS rises significantly in years like 2016-2017 and 2022-2023, while SOS increases over time. This shows that the program is improving even with tougher competition. We see that the team has been able to maintain its high level of playing even against increasingly strong opponents.\n\n\nCode\nbb_long &lt;- bb %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"PS.G\", \"PA.G\"),  # Select PS/G and PA/G for the columns\n               names_to = \"Metric\", \n               values_to = \"Value\")\nbb_long$Season &lt;- factor(bb_long$Season, levels = rev(unique(bb_long$Season)))\n\nggplot(bb_long, aes(x = Season, y = Value, fill = Metric)) +  \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Creighton Basketball: Points Scored vs Allowed by Season\",\n    subtitle = \"Stacked comparison of offense and defense from 2014 to 2025\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Points per Game\",\n    fill = \"Metric\",\n    caption = \"Author: Lily Nenenan | Source: Sports-Reference.com\"\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"PS.G\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"PA.G\" = \"#e31a1c\")) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we looks at how many points Creighton scored and allowed per game, season by season.\nOffensively the team has been consistently strong. There are minor changes year to year, but overall the pattern shows that Creighton regularly puts up solid total points. Defensively, we see the trend is improvement. In recent seasons, points allowed per game has gone down slightly.\nThis shows a team that’s not only focused on outscoring, but also limiting their opponents chances - which is crucial in tight games.\nIn conclusion, the past decade of Creighton Men’s Basketball can be summed up as a steady growth. The team’s metrics show consistent winning, and strong performance. It is clear that the Bluejay’s are moving forward.\nWhether you are looking at SRS, win percentages, or scoring margins, the numbers show that this is a team that has grown into a reliable program at the national level."

    "section": "",
    "text": "NCAA Gymnastics has been dominated by the SEC for years. As the 2025 season comes to a close, it is clear that the Southeastern Conference (SEC) continues to be a powerhouse in collegiate gymnastics. But how do other conferences compare? Which conference really is the strongest when we look closely at the numbers?\nUsing data from the 2025 season, we can break down the rankings based on each teams National Qualifying Score (NQS) and see which conferences are competitive.\nBased on each teams NQS this graph shows which conferences have the most teams ranked in the top 36. These teams represent the highest level of competition and are a major indicator of which conference is the strongest.\n\n\nCode\nknitr:: opts_chunk$set(\n  echo = TRUE,\n  message = FALSE,\n  warning = FALSE,\n  results = 'hide'\n)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngymnastics_data &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_gymnastics_teams.csv\")\n\ntop_teams &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(`Team NQS`)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:36)\n \nconferences &lt;- c(\"SEC\", \"Big 12\", \"SEC\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"SEC\", \n                 \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"SEC\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"SEC\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\",\n                 \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Pac-12\", \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"WAC\", \"Big Ten\", \n                 \"Pac-12\", \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big Ten\", \"Mountain West\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\", \n                 \"Big 12\", \"Mountain West\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big West\")\n\ntop_teams$Conference &lt;- conferences\n\ngymnastics_data &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(top_teams %&gt;% select(Team, Conference), by = \"Team\")\n\nconference_counts &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Team %in% top_teams$Team) %&gt;% \n  count(Conference, sort = TRUE)\n\n\ntop36_plot &lt;- ggplot(conference_counts, aes(x = reorder(Conference, -n), y = n, fill = Conference)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which NCAA Gymnastics Conference Is the Strongest?\", \n    subtitle = \"Based on number of teams ranked in the top 36 by National Qualifying Score (NQS)\", \n    x = \"Conference\", \n    y = \"Number of Top-36 Teams\", \n    caption = \"Author: Lily Neneman | Source: RoadToNationals.com\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\", \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\nggsave(\"top36.png\", plot = top36_plot, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300, bg = \"white\")\n\n\n\nClearly, the Big Ten leads with the most teams in the top 36 (10). But does the number of teams tell us the whole story?\nWhile the SEC has 2 fewer teams in the Big Ten, it remains a powerhouse in NCAA Gymnastics. The SEC teams often performs at a higher level than other teams. They are known for being home to many top-tier athletes and programs that dominate national competitions.\nHowever, it is also clear that the Big Ten has become a strong contender in recent years. The Pac-12 also has maintained a consistent presence in NCAA Gymnastics and competes at a high level.\nLet’s take a closer look at each teams National Qualifying Scores.\n\n\nCode\ntop_teams &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(`Team NQS`)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:36)\n\nconferences &lt;- c(\"SEC\", \"Big 12\", \"SEC\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"SEC\", \n                 \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"SEC\", \"Pac-12\", \"Pac-12\", \"SEC\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\",\n                 \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Pac-12\", \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"WAC\", \"Big Ten\", \n                 \"Pac-12\", \"ACC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big Ten\", \"Mountain West\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\", \n                 \"Big 12\", \"Mountain West\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big West\")\n\ntop_teams$Conference &lt;- conferences\n\ngymnastics_data &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(top_teams %&gt;% select(Team, Conference), by = \"Team\")\n\ntop_data &lt;- gymnastics_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Team %in% top_teams$Team)\n\nteam_scores &lt;- top_teams %&gt;%\n  select(Team, Conference, `Team NQS`) %&gt;%\n  rename(NQS = `Team NQS`) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Conference, desc(NQS)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Team = factor(Team, levels = unique(Team)))\n\ntop_scores_to_label &lt;- team_scores %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(NQS)) %&gt;% \n  slice_head(n = 5) \n\nNQSdotplot &lt;- ggplot(team_scores, aes(x = Conference, y = NQS, color = Conference)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NQS Distribution Across Conferences\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing the National Qualifying Scores of NCAA Gymnastics Teams\",\n    x = \"Conference\",\n    y = \"National Qualifying Score (NQS)\",\n    caption = \"Author: Lily Neneman | Source: RoadToNationals.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),  \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)  \n  ) +\n  geom_text(data = top_scores_to_label, aes(label = round(NQS, 2)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 3, color = \"black\")\n\nggsave(\"NQSdotplot.png\", plot = NQSdotplot, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300, bg = \"white\")\n\n\n\nThis graph compares the National Qualifying Scores of the top 36 teams across each conference. Each dot shows us one of these top teams. This gives us a good sense of how these teams are actually performing and whether certain conferences achieve higher scores in competition.\nIt is noticeable that the dots representing SEC teams are at the top of the graph. This indicates that SEC teams are consistently producing some of the highest NQS. While the SEC doesn’t have the most teams in the top 36 (the Big Ten has a couple more), their teams seem to outperform those from other conferences in terms of scores. This in and of itself shows their dominance.\nThe Big Ten, on the other hand, has more teams in the top 36, but tends to score lower. This suggests that while they may have a larger representation they don’t always perform as well.\nWe can also see that in some conferences like the Big 12 and Pac-12 they have a few teams with high scores but lack consistency. And other conferences like the Big West and Mountain West just score lower overall. This is a good represntation of consistency within conferences and shows which teams within each conference are dominating NCAA gymnastics right now.\nNow, we can dial in on the strongest teams.\n\n\nCode\ntop_10_data &lt;- top_teams %&gt;% \n  top_n(10, Avg)   \nbar &lt;- ggplot(top_10_data, aes(x = Team, y = Avg, color = Conference)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(Avg, 2)), \n            vjust = 1.5,  \n            hjust = 0.5,  \n            color = \"red\", \n            size = 2, \n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + \n  facet_wrap(~Conference, scales = \"free_y\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Teams Grouped by Conference\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing teams based on their Average Team Score\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Average Score\",\n    caption = \"Author: Lily Neneman | Source: RoadToNationals.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 10, 20, 10), \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),  \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)  \n  )\nggsave(\"grouped.png\", plot = bar, bg = \"white\", width = 10, height = 8)\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the top 10 teams by their average team score in the 2025 season grouped by their conference. The SEC continues to dominate with 5 teams in the top 10. The Pac-12 has 3 teams, while the Big Ten and Big 12 each have 1 team in the top 10.\nWhile the average scores are overall quite similar, the SEC’s strong representation shows their consistent performances at the very highest level. This also gives us a better look at how the Big Ten lags behind when it comes to the very best of the best in scores.\nIt is evident from this data that it is true, the SEC continues to dominate NCAA Gymnastics. Although the Big Ten has more teams in the top half of NCAA teams, their scores trend lower overall. The Pac-12 and Big 12 have very strong teams but they still don’t match the pattern of quality teams we see in the Southeastern Conference.\nAs the season draws to a close with nationals coming up, it will be interesting to see who, if anyone, catches up. But for now, it is clear that based on the 2025 gymnastics season the SEC remains the top conference in NCAA Gymnastics."
