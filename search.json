    "text": "NCAA Gymnastics has been dominated by the SEC for years. As the 2025 season comes to a close, it is clear that the Southeastern Conference (SEC) continues to be a powerhouse in collegiate gymnastics. But how do other conferences compare? Which conference really is the strongest when we look closely at the numbers?\nUsing data from the 2025 season, we can break down the rankings based on each teams National Qualifying Score (NQS) and see which conferences are competitive.\nBased on each teams NQS this graph shows which conferences have the most teams ranked in the top 36. These teams represent the highest level of competition and are a major indicator of which conference is the strongest.\n\nClearly, the Big Ten leads with the most teams in the top 36 (10). But does the number of teams tell us the whole story?\nWhile the SEC has 2 fewer teams in the Big Ten, it remains a powerhouse in NCAA Gymnastics. The SEC teams often performs at a higher level than other teams. They are known for being home to many top-tier athletes and programs that dominate national competitions.\nHowever, it is also clear that the Big Ten has become a strong contender in recent years. The Pac-12 also has maintained a consistent presence in NCAA Gymnastics and competes at a high level.\nLet’s take a closer look at each teams National Qualifying Scores.\n\nThis graph compares the National Qualifying Scores of the top 36 teams across each conference. Each dot shows us one of these top teams. This gives us a good sense of how these teams are actually performing and whether certain conferences achieve higher scores in competition.\nIt is noticeable that the dots representing SEC teams are at the top of the graph. This indicates that SEC teams are consistently producing some of the highest NQS. While the SEC doesn’t have the most teams in the top 36 (the Big Ten has a couple more), their teams seem to outperform those from other conferences in terms of scores. This in and of itself shows their dominance.\nThe Big Ten, on the other hand, has more teams in the top 36, but tends to score lower. This suggests that while they may have a larger representation they don’t always perform as well.\nWe can also see that in some conferences like the Big 12 and Pac-12 they have a few teams with high scores but lack consistency. And other conferences like the Big West and Mountain West just score lower overall. This is a good represntation of consistency within conferences and shows which teams within each conference are dominating NCAA gymnastics right now.\nNow, we can dial in on the strongest teams.\n\nThis graph shows the top 10 teams by their average team score in the 2025 season grouped by their conference. The SEC continues to dominate with 5 teams in the top 10. The Pac-12 has 3 teams, while the Big Ten and Big 12 each have 1 team in the top 10.\nWhile the average scores are overall quite similar, the SEC’s strong representation shows their consistent performances at the very highest level. This also gives us a better look at how the Big Ten lags behind when it comes to the very best of the best in scores.\nIt is evident from this data that it is true, the SEC continues to dominate NCAA Gymnastics. Although the Big Ten has more teams in the top half of NCAA teams, their scores trend lower overall. The Pac-12 and Big 12 have very strong teams but they still don’t match the pattern of quality teams we see in the Southeastern Conference.\nAs the season draws to a close with nationals coming up, it will be interesting to see who, if anyone, catches up. But for now, it is clear that based on the 2025 gymnastics season the SEC remains the top conference in NCAA Gymnastics."
